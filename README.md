# **Crop Disease Detection using EfficientNet and PyTorch**

This project focuses on detecting crop diseases across 15 distinct classes using a deep learning model built with PyTorch and EfficientNet. The model is trained on the Bangladeshi Crops Disease Dataset, providing robust classification capabilities to assist in early disease detection for effective agricultural management.
